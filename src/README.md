| POST   | `/auth/teacher`                                                    | Verify teacher credentials                                          |
| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity (teacher authentication required)           |

Teacher credentials are sent using HTTP Basic authentication. Use HTTPS when deploying outside a trusted local development environment.

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.
